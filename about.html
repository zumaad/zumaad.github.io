                    Apart from working on the projects shown on the front page, in my free time,
                I like playing chess (mostly rapid time controls), weightlifting, virtual investing, and reading about whatever 
                interests me at that time.

            My Computer Science Interests
        </h3>
        <div style="text-align:left">
            <pre><p>
                    My interests are pretty broad currently. In general, I enjoy solving problems and creating tools
                regardless of the subfield of CS. But, so far, from what I've experienced in my projects and school, 
                I really enjoy Data Science, Web development, and AI.

            What I'm working on currently
        </h3>
        <div style="text-align:left">
            <pre><p>
                    I'm taking a really interesting upper level CS class at my university called Artificial Intelligence,
                and it has stoked my interest in AI, so I'm coming up with various ideas to apply what
                I'm learning in class and do another project. Some things that have come to mind are creating a bot for a 
                game that I play, called runescape, or automated crossword puzzle solving using CSPs.
